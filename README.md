 This folder contains projects that demonstrate the skills I have developed through self teaching.

Message Mixer:

is a messaging service that allows you to perform an action on input text and display the output of that behavior to the console. For example, with the current functions defined in Message Mixer, you can:

count the characters in a message
capitalize the first character of words
reverse a message’s words in place
reversing characters in place
replace the first occurrence of a string
replace all occurrences of a string
encode text by swapping certain characters for other characters


Using modules I fixed the messy code to make it more presentable and easier to work with by seperating functions into one file. Then used named exports in the form of variables for use in the entire program.

The point is to collect the moneybags while avoiding the file cabinets.

MealMaker 

In this project, I used JavaScript to randomly create a three-course meal based on what is available on a menu. We’ll keep running it until we’re satisfied with the generated meal!

This project helped me practice creating objects and how you can use those objects to manipulate various data and store it in a cleaner process.

Mini Linter 

In this project, I used what I knew about iterating over arrays to improve the quality of a paragraph and gather some information about that paragraph.

Sleep Debt Calculator 

In this project I practiced my use of functions to calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a sleep debt calculator.

Chore Door 

My project was to construct a single-page website that plays a fully-functional game. I used javascript to change the items within a given html element using .innerHTML, .getElementById.
